c2do is a simple todo app to share lists, todos and tasks.

the following main goals are outlined:

* to implement a foundation4 based frontend for mobile and desktop navigation
* to implement a hierarchic structure of lists [containing todos [containing tasks]] which each can be shared with other users
* a simple and engaging invitation model for users to engage them to share their lists/ todos/ tasks
